# abinit_assets
This directory contains files available publicly, although not shipped in the ABINIT package distribution.
In particular, big datafiles for some ABINIT tutorials might be found here. Also, slides presented at ABINIT events might be stored here.

The names of directories should match the ones present in the ABINIT package when possible, possibly reproducing
the whole directory structure. Of course, some assets might not correspond to specific directories in the ABINIT package,
and should be contained in additional directories.
