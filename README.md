# abinit_assets
This directory contains files available publicly, although not shipped in the ABINIT package distribution.

In particular, big datafiles for some ABINIT tutorials might be found here (in the subdirectory abinit_package). 
In that subdirectory, the names of directories should match the ones present in the ABINIT package when possible, possibly reproducing
the whole directory structure. 

For the assets linked to items displayed on the ABINIT web site, the corresponding top directory is abinit_web_site.
