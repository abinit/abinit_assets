# abinit_package
This directory contains files available publicly, although not shipped in the ABINIT package distribution.
In particular, big datafiles for some ABINIT tutorials might be found here. Also, .pdf of ABINIT papers prior to publication.
(in order not to infringe copyright).

The names of directories should match the ones present in the ABINIT package when possible, possibly reproducing
the whole directory structure.
